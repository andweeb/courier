# Courier
A visual abstraction of the Secure File Transfer Protocol ([SFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol)) to view, transfer, and traverse through files and directories between SSH-enabled remote servers on your web browser.

###### A preinstall script runs `go get . && go install .` Ensure that Go is installed correctly and the repository path is in your `$GOPATH`

## Demo
Here's a demo of a couple file transfers from one of the computers at the CSIF @ UC Davis (on the left) to an iPhone filesystem (on the right).
