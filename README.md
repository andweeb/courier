# Courier

For the sake of learning ES6, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), Flux ([Redux](http://redux.js.org)), and [Go](https://golang.org) all in one swoop ðŸ’€, here persists Courier, a visual abstraction of the Secure File Transfer Protocol.

###### Disclaimer: This is a very-far-from-finished WIP, so the code may not follow the best React/Redux practices <br /> (I'm still learning so please let me know which parts to fix!)

### Installing
Uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to bundle the frontend and live-reload the go server.

- `npm install` 
- `npm start`
- Go to `http://localhost:1337`

A rough but functional prototype of Courier written in Node.js exists in the `old` branch.  <br /> Unfortunately only works in Chrome ðŸ˜¥.
Run the following commands:

- `git checkout old`
- `npm install` 
- `node app.js`
- Go to `http://localhost:1337`
